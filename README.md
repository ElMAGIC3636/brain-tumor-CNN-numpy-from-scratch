# Brain Tumor Classification with CNN (NumPy from Scratch)

"" for educational purpose only ""

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch using only **NumPy** (without TensorFlow or PyTorch).  
It classifies brain MRI images into four categories:  
- **Glioma Tumor**  
- **Meningioma Tumor**  
- **Pituitary Tumor**  
- **No Tumor**

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used is the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)) available on Kaggle.  
It contains MRI images labeled into the four classes listed above.  

NOTE: ‚ö†Ô∏è The dataset is too large to be included in this repository.  
Please download it separately from Kaggle and place it inside a `data/` folder.
